    <h1>About Juicy Roasted Chicken</h1>
    <p>This roasted chicken is perfectly seasoned and just like the way my grandmother used to make it.</p>
    <p> The method used in this recipe results in the juiciest chicken! We loved to nibble on the celery after it was cooked.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.</li>
      <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.</li>
        <li><strong>Celery</strong>: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Season the chicken inside and out.</li>
      <li>Add the butter to the chicken and the pan.</li>
      <li>Stuff the cavity with celery.</li>
      <li>Bake until the chicken is fully roasted.</li>
    </ol>
